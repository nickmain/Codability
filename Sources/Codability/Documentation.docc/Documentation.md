# ``Codability``

A collection of macros and property wrappers to help with Codable conformance.

Original source is at [https://github.com/nickmain/Codability](https://github.com/nickmain/Codability)

This collection currently contains the following utilities:

* ``CodingKeys(_:)`` - a macro to allow minimal specification of alternate coding keys
* ``TC`` - a property wrapper that proxies Codable conformance to allow fixing deficiencies.
